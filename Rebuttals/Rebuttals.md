# Writing rebuttals for SIGCHI submissions
by Chat Wacharamanotham

Many conferences affiliated with ACM SIGCHI allow the authors to write a short respond to the reviews. This document aims to help you craft a successful rebuttal.
90% of the content below is not new.
(See the end of this article.)
I wrote this to organize my thoughts on the matter, consolidate existing resources, and to provide a unified framing and procedure for people in my lab.

__How to use this article:__ I'd recommend reading the first two sections before you read the reviews.
These sections hopefully put you in an appropriate mindset to read the reviews and empathize with the reviewers and the program committee.

## Purposes, process, and key players

The scientific purposes of rebuttal are 

	Purpose 1: to clarify *reviewers' misunderstandings*, and 

	Purpose 2: to propose how the *minor flaws* that are *correctly identified* by the reviewers will be addressed in the final version of the paper. 

In established journals, the authors and the reviewers converse in multiple rounds of feedback and revision, each round improves the quality of the paper.
For conference submissions, the time constraint usually limits the rebuttal or resubmission into one round.
Thus, the role of rebuttals extends beyond scientific to strategic and rhetoric.
This section will focus on strategical issues.

### Key players and abbreviations

(If you are already familiar with this process, you may skip this section.)

* ACs: associate chairs
* 1AC: first AC, primary reviewer, meta-reviewer
* 2AC: second AC
* R1: reviewer 1 (The number assign by the reviewing system. R1 is not necessarily the 1AC.)
* PC: program committee, comprises of all the ACs
* PC meeting: the meeting that decides which articles will be accepted to the conference
* SCs: subcommittee/subarea chairs (For large conferences, PC meetings are split into several groups. Each group is lead by an SC.)
* TPC: Technical program chair: coordinate the PC meeting (or all SC meetings).

The discussion below assume one-level of PC meeting, so we won't mention SC and TPC.

### Summary of the review process

(If you are already familiar with this process, you may skip this section.)

This is a general review process of ACM SIGCHI conferences.
Recently, there're several adjustments. 
See the website of your conference for specific details.

1. After the paper submission deadline, each AC will be assigned with a set of papers (either by SC, TPC, or a bidding process).
All ACs can see the metadata (title, list of authors) of all submissions, non-anonymized.

2. The AC, who is now being the 1AC of your paper, will then solicit external reviewers (typically 2–3) to write an in-depth review of your paper. 
In some conferences, 2AC is asked to write a review, solicit external reviewers, or both.

3. All reviewers will have around one month to read and write the review for your paper.
Each reviewer will also have to rate the paper on the scale 1 to 5, where 5 is strong accept and 1 is strong reject.
Reviewers __may not be experts__ in the substantive domain or the methodology that you used in your paper.
However, ACs generally try their best to recruit appropriate reviewers.

4. After the reviewing deadline, 1AC will consolidate the feedback, lead an online discussion among reviewers. This aims to create a consensus among reviewers.

5. 1AC writes a __meta-review__, which typically summarize the consensus.
However, 1AC has a strong influence in prioritizing the issues that the authors need to address.

6. The reviews (including the meta-review) are sent to the authors. 
(The content from the online discussion is not visible to the authors.)

7. The authors typically have one week to write a rebuttal, typically max. 5000 characters. 
(Some conferences allow several weeks to revise and resubmit the whole paper.
The revise-and-resubmit process is out of scope of this article.)

8. 1AC will ask reviewers to read the rebuttal, add a comment, and possibly adjust their rating. 
Sometimes, there are online discussion about the rebuttal and further decisions.
1AC is responsible to summarize these discussion and represent the consensus of the reviewers at the PC meeting.

9. In the PC meeting, all papers are sorted by the average rating, and each papers are discussed.
Typical strategy is to discuss easy-accepts and easy-rejects (very high and very low score) before spending more time for those in the middle.

    * For each paper, 1AC will give a summary of the contribution and the summary of the reviewers' consensus.
      How the 1AC describe your paper will set tone of the discussion about your paper at the PC meeting.
      Thus, __the 1AC is the key person to determine acceptance of your paper__.

    * Sometimes, the 2AC may also weight in his/her opinion and may also override 1AC, depending on the scientific expertise and influences of him/her in the PC meeting.

    * Other members in the PC may read the abstract, and the meta-review. 
      They may skim the first page of your paper and look at the video figure, but unlikely to do more.
      But it is unlikely that they will have read the paper and other reviews in detail.

    * For difficult submission (e.g., high SD in the reviewers' score), other members in the PC may be assigned or may volunteer to provide additional review in a very short time (overnight, after a tiresome day of the PC meeting). 
      This person will become 3AC.
      In such case, the decision will be made on the following day with the opinion of all ACs weighted in.


10. After the PC meeting, 1AC summarizes the results, which will be sent to the authors. 
If the paper is conditionally accepted, 1AC will be responsible to ensure that the authors made revision as promised in the rebuttal.


### Strategic purposes of rebuttals

Considering the process above, rebuttals now have two additional strategic purposes.

	Purpose 1: to clarify *reviewers' misunderstandings*, and 

	Purpose 2: to propose how the *minor flaws* that are *correctly identified* by the reviewers will be addressed in the final version of the paper. 
	
	Purpose 3: Create a least resistance path for the  1AC to champion your paper in the PC meeting.
	
	Purpose 4: Convince potential additional ACs to give favorable opinion on your paper.

Thus, the audience of your rebuttal are (in the order of importance): 1AC, 2AC, PC members, and reviewers. 

Before we discuss the rhetoric of the rebuttals, we will have a look at the practical recommendation of how to read the reviews.


## How to process the reviews

Reviews are, by definition, criticisms of your work.
Reading them will naturally invoke emotional responses, which is mostly negative.
To write a successful rebuttal, you'll need

   1. __empathy__ to see the reviewers' point of view, and 
   2. __creativity__ to figure how to address the reviewers' concerns and how to convince them.

Therefore, I recommend the following process.

__Step 1:__ 
Forward the reviews to all co-authors so that they have all information.

__Step 2:__ 
Print the reviews out and go offline. Read through the reviews in one pass without annotating them.

* I recommend printing out to avoid doing anything rash online. Having the reviews on paper is also facilitate deep and analytical reading in later steps.


__Step 3:__ 
Take up to 24 hours to take care of your emotional responses. 

* Here are some ideas: writing an angry rebuttal (but don't send them out), doing sports, meditate, cleaning or playing a hack-and-slash game. 

* The exact duration depends on the reviews. Negative reviews typically invoke stronger emotional responses and need more time to calm down.

__Step 4:__ 
Summarize the reviewers' score and expertise

    Avg: 3.0
    1AC: 3.0 (expert)
    2AC: 3.0 (knowledgable)
     R1: 2.5 (expert)
     R2: 3.5 (knowledgable)

__Step 5:__ 
Analyze the reviews by marking the praises and criticisms. 

* I typically do this on paper. If my collaborators are not collocated, I reproduce the markings in computer after step 6

__Step 6:__ 
Make two lists: one with praise, another with criticisms. For each point, add a parenthesis referring back to the reviewer like the example below. 

    (–) unclear experimental procedure (1AC, R3)

* I recommend using 1AC or 2AC instead of R# to make them prominent.
Put the ACs first.
* Make this list on Google Doc because you will be modifying it afterwards and will share with your co-authors.

__Step 7:__ 
Sort the list by prioritizing the 1AC and the 2AC's criticisms.

__Perform the following step for each criticism:__

__Step 8:__ 
Annotate parts in your paper that are relevant.
Add the page number to your list.

    (–) unclear experimental procedure (1AC, R3) [p4]

__Step 9:__ 
Read the part of paper that you highlighted from reviewers' perspective.
Add your judgement of the review: justified, misunderstood, unjustified. 
Note down your ideas for responses.

    (–) unclear experimental procedure (1AC, R3) [p4] JUSTIFIED
        * expand step 2
        * rewrite step 3
        * add a picture of the stimuli
    
__Step 10:__ 
Send your summary (from step 4 and step 9), your annotated reviews (step 5), and your annotated paper (step 8) to all co-authors.
If you use Google Doc, collect everything in one Google Drive folder and share.

## Crafting the rebuttal

### Strategies

### Logistics

### Structure
* Thanks the reviewers
* Highlight positive points that the reviewers mentioned.
* For each of the major points (in order mentioned in the meta-review):
   * Summary of the concern
   * Reference to specific reviewers (e.g., "R1")
   * Address the criticism briefly ("Agreed")
   * Clarify and describe the changes that you plan to make.
* Minor points: summarize them altogether and say that you will fix them.
* Brief positive wrap-up (if space permits)

#OLD VERSION

#### Write down your initial responses are the *raw materials*

After you have read the reviews, you may have an idea to address each point. 
Note them down on a separate piece of paper.
Consider these notes *only as raw materials* for your rebuttals.
Why? At this point, you are cognitively overloaded from the new information from the review, your initial responses and strategies, and the emotional residue.
Thus, it is more likely that your responses at this stage to be rough, or even worse, missing the point altogether.
Nevertheless, it's good to capture them down on paper, to reduce the cognitive load in your head; therefore, write them down nonetheless.
For some people (me), the act of writing them down (instead of typing) also signal the brain that something had been done to address the emotional threats.

I recommend using a separate piece of paper because it will be less distracting when you re-read the reviews in the next step.


#### Re-reading and discussion
TODO
* read between lines: will this reviewer likely to improve the rating for your paper?

Choosing the points to be included in the rebuttal
===
Wendy Mackay mentioned two roles of rebuttals [1]:
* Answer AC's critiques
* Help AC fight for the paper

The word count is limited. Usually, you won't be able to address all concerns mentioned by the reviewers.


> Rule #: The AC is your champion

Note the emphasis on "AC" in the purposes above, who will present and champion your paper during the PC meeting.
Since every characters count, I'd recommend prioritizing points that the ACs mentioned before addressing the points form other reviewers.
You can usually expect the AC to summarize their concerns at the end of their meta-review.

> Rule #: Address major concerns from other reviewers

Having said that, you should address the major concerns raised by other reviewers that wasn't mentioned in meta-review as well.
Although the AC may not see this as crucial, your paper may get a secondary reviewer at the PC meeting, who will have one night to read your paper as well as all reviews, and write another review.
In my experience, the review from the secondary reviewer can flip the results upside down, especially when AC and other reviewers don't have strong opinion.

Improving the rating for your paper may have minor positive effect during the PC meeting.
Some subcommittees sort the papers by score and consider the easy ones first (definitely accept, definitely reject).


Crafting your rebuttal
===

> Rule #: Be brief and organized
  
  The reviewers may need to read many rebuttals. (Also, each AC handles from 5–10 papers, depending on the conference.)
  So, it helps to be concise.
  You want to make it as easy as possible, especially for the AC to read your rebuttal.
  Here are some tips:
  * Order your rebuttal points according to AC's order in the meta-review. (The AC is your champion.)
  * Include explicit reference to reviewers (R1, R2)
  * Section your rebuttal with ALLCAPS.

> Rule #: Be specific about the changes

State "*what* you are going to change and *how*" [2].
To increase the confidence of the reviewers, you should demonstrate that you can change in the rebuttal.
For example, if a text was unclear, provide a clearer version in the rebuttal and mention that you will include or expand this text in the revision.
If a figure needs to be changed, change and upload it to an anonymous server and put the link in the rebuttal.
(You cannot expect reviewers to look at anything beyond the rebuttal itself though. So you still need to briefly describe the figure you proposed in the text.)
  
> Rule #: Be polite

If the reviewer misunderstood your paper, provide clarification in your rebuttal and suggest that you will *improve your writing*. 
("its' a problem of your writing, not the reviewer" [2])

Rather than arguing with the reviewers, offer to clarify the points and blame it on the writing (instead of the scientific content).


> Rule #: Show your capability

Show that you know what you are talking about, but don't be smart ass.
Reviewers are human; they don't want to be looked down.

If spelling and grammar is a concern, make sure that your rebuttal doesn't have any flaws in those aspects.




Tips for text compression
===



No-nos
===
* Don't use non-ASCII characters (quotes, dashes, ellipsis). 
   * Especially when you draft your rebuttal in MS Word or Apple Pages.
   * E.g., the quotation marks ("...") are often automatically converted (“...”)

Other points todo:
===
* You may need to have a "meta conversation with the AC" instead of "addressing each points" (when the reviewers misunderstood the paper and wrote the review in a misguided direciton)
