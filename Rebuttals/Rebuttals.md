Reading the reviews
===

#### Read the reviews objectively


Typical reviews are essentially 90% critique of your research and (hopefully) 10% of praise.
But that doesn't mean that your research is shit (technical term, means "of no good").
It is possible that reading the reviews of your paper may trigger the threat response.
This reduces empathy (to see the reviewers' point of view) and creativity (to figure how to address the reviewers' concerns).
To keep your emotional state intact, you have to approach the reviews objectively.

To put your ego aside, I'd recommend reading the reviews as if you are not the authors of the paper.
(The reviews addresses the "past" you who are the author anyway. The "present" you is a totally different person.)

You should also analyze the reviews from different lenses. Try asking the following questions for each point in the reviews.
* What topic is the concern? (E.g., design, implementation, evaluation, related work)
* Do you agree with the concern?
* Is it factual or opinion?
* How important do the reviewers consider this point? (Ranged from good-to-have or deal-breaker)
* Is it hard or easy to address?
* Is it a recurring concern, from the same or from multiple reviewers?
* Is it mentioned by the AC?
* How confident/expert does the reviewer seems to be for each of the point?

Note that these dimensions may not correlate. 
Important points can be easy to address. 
Recurring points may not be important.
Also, the length that the reviewer spent on this point may not correlate with the importance.
Breaking down these points and analyze them from one lens at a time will lessen the cognitive load required, making you less prone to emotional responses.

If you are a visual person, like me, this spreadsheet may be useful for breaking down points of the reviews [[Apple Numbers]](Review analysis.numbers) [[PDF]](Review analysis.pdf).

#### Write down your initial responses are the *raw materials*

After you have read the reviews, you may have an idea to address each point. 
Note them down on a separate piece of paper.
Consider these notes *only as raw materials* for your rebuttals.
Why? At this point, you are cognitively overloaded from the new information from the review, your initial responses and strategies, and the emotional residue.
Thus, it is more likely that your responses at this stage to be rough, or even worse, missing the point altogether.
Nevertheless, it's good to capture them down on paper, to reduce the cognitive load in your head; therefore, write them down nonetheless.
For some people (me), the act of writing them down (instead of typing) also signal the brain that something had been done to address the emotional threats.

I recommend using a separate piece of paper because it will be less distracting when you re-read the reviews in the next step.

#### Take a break after initial reading

Now, it's time to take some rest for a night.
Resting will replenish glucose in your prefrontal cortex and allow your hippocampus to consolidate the information as well as pruning unnecessary points.
(This is why I told you to write your responses down.)

#### Re-reading and discussion
TODO
* read between lines: will this reviewer likely to improve the rating for your paper?

Choosing the points to be included in the rebuttal
===
Wendy Mackay mentioned two roles of rebuttals [1]:
* Answer AC's critiques
* Help AC fight for the paper

The word count is limited. Usually, you won't be able to address all concerns mentioned by the reviewers.


> Rule #: The AC is your champion

Note the emphasis on "AC" in the purposes above, who will present and champion your paper during the PC meeting.
Since every characters count, I'd recommend prioritizing points that the ACs mentioned before addressing the points form other reviewers.
You can usually expect the AC to summarize their concerns at the end of their meta-review.

> Rule #: Address major concerns from other reviewers

Having said that, you should address the major concerns raised by other reviewers that wasn't mentioned in meta-review as well.
Although the AC may not see this as crucial, your paper may get a secondary reviewer at the PC meeting, who will have one night to read your paper as well as all reviews, and write another review.
In my experience, the review from the secondary reviewer can flip the results upside down, especially when AC and other reviewers don't have strong opinion.

Improving the rating for your paper may have minor positive effect during the PC meeting.
Some subcommittees sort the papers by score and consider the easy ones first (definitely accept, definitely reject).


Crafting your rebuttal
===

> Rule #: Be brief and organized
  
  The reviewers may need to read many rebuttals. (Also, each AC handles from 5–10 papers, depending on the conference.)
  So, it helps to be concise.
  You want to make it as easy as possible, especially for the AC to read your rebuttal.
  Here are some tips:
  * Order your rebuttal points according to AC's order in the meta-review. (The AC is your champion.)
  * Include explicit reference to reviewers (R1, R2)
  * Section your rebuttal with ALLCAPS.

> Rule #: Be specific about the changes

State "*what* you are going to change and *how*" [2].
To increase the confidence of the reviewers, you should demonstrate that you can change in the rebuttal.
For example, if a text was unclear, provide a clearer version in the rebuttal and mention that you will include or expand this text in the revision.
If a figure needs to be changed, change and upload it to an anonymous server and put the link in the rebuttal.
(You cannot expect reviewers to look at anything beyond the rebuttal itself though. So you still need to briefly describe the figure you proposed in the text.)
  
> Rule #: Be polite

If the reviewer misunderstood your paper, provide clarification in your rebuttal and suggest that you will *improve your writing*. 
("its' a problem of your writing, not the reviewer" [2])

Rather than arguing with the reviewers, offer to clarify the points and blame it on the writing (instead of the scientific content).


> Rule #: Show your capability

Show that you know what you are talking about, but don't be smart ass.
Reviewers are human; they don't want to be looked down.

If spelling and grammar is a concern, make sure that your rebuttal doesn't have any flaws in those aspects.


Typical structure of a rebuttal
===
* Thanks the reviewers
* Highlight positive points that the reviewers mentioned.
* For each of the major points (in order mentioned in the meta-review):
   * Summary of the concern
   * Reference to specific reviewers (e.g., "R1")
   * Address the criticism briefly ("Agreed") [2]
   * Clarify and describe the changes that you plan to make.
* Minor points: summarize them altogether and say that you will fix them. [2]
* Brief positive wrap-up (if space permits) [2]

Tips for text compression
===



No-nos
===
* Don't use non-ASCII characters (quotes, dashes, ellipsis). 
   * Especially when you draft your rebuttal in MS Word or Apple Pages.
   * E.g., the quotation marks ("...") are often automatically converted (“...”)
