Reading the reviews
===
Typical reviews are essentially 90% critique of your research and (hopefully) 10% of praise.
But that doesn't mean that your research is shit (technical term, means "of no good").
It is possible that reading the reviews of your paper may trigger the threat response.
This reduces empathy (to see the reviewers' point of view) and creativity (to figure how to address the reviewers' concerns).
To keep your emotional state intact, you have to approach the reviews objectively.
  > Rule #: Read the reviews objectively ("past you", break down assessment)

To put your ego aside, I'd recommend reading the reviews as if you are not the authors of the paper.
(The reviews addresses the "past" you who are the author anyway. The "present" you is a totally different person.)

You should also analyze the reviews from different lenses. Try asking the following questions for each point in the reviews.
* What topic is the concern? (E.g., design, implementation, evaluation, related work)
* Do you agree with the concern?
* Is it factual or opinion?
* How important do the reviewers consider this point? (Ranged from good-to-have or deal-breaker)
* Is it hard or easy to address?
* Is it a recurring concern, from the same or from multiple reviewers?
* Is it mentioned by the AC?
* How confident/expert does the reviewer seems to be for each of the point?


Note that these dimensions may not correlate. 
Important points can be easy to address. 
Recurring points may not be important.
Also, the length that the reviewer spent on this point may not correlate with the importance.

If you are a visual person, like me, this spreadsheet may be useful for breaking down points of the reviews [[Apple Numbers]](Review analysis.numbers) [[PDF]](Review analysis.pdf).


Choosing the points to be included in the rebuttal
===
Wendy Mackay mentioned two roles of rebuttals [1]:
* Answer AC's critiques
* Help AC fight for the paper


The word count is limited. Usually, you won't be able to address all concerns mentioned by the reviewers.

Note the emphasis on "AC" in the purposes above, who will present and champion your paper during the PC meeting.
Since every characters count, I'd recommend prioritizing points that the ACs mentioned before addressing the points form other reviewers.
You can usually expect the AC to summarize their concerns at the end of their meta-review.
  > Rule #: Address all concerns mentioned by the AC.

Having said that, you should address the major concerns raised by other reviewers that wasn't mentioned in meta-review as well.
Although the AC may not see this as crucial, your paper may get a secondary reviewer at the PC meeting, who will have one night to read your paper as well as all reviews, and write another review.
In my experience, the review from the secondary reviewer can flip the results upside down, especially when AC and other reviewers don't have strong opinion.
