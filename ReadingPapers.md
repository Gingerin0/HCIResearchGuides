This is a quick guide on how to read papers. It is drafted as a hint for students in HCI classs. It's certainly not comprehensive.

Summary: Don't read from the beginning til the end. Start by asking what you want to learn to form the paper and strategically read parts of the paper enough for you to answer your questions. From time to time, stop reading and reflect if your questions were answered and how confident you are with the answers.

In detail:

1. Start with questions: What do you want to learn from the paper?

2. Read title and abstract. Then try to make sense of what they mean.

   * What's the contribution? In other words, what the new knowledge does this paper describe?
   * How do the authors know it? In other words, what's the method that they use to gain that knowledge?

3. If you are still unclear about the context (i.e., why does this matter?), read the first section (usually Introduction, in this paper: Background)

4. Skim (flip through and selectively read here and there) the paper. (easier in print-outs) Notice the following:

   * The title of major sections → you can infer how the content is organized
   * Figures → usually give you a good idea of what they contribute. If the figure looks interesting, read the figure caption

5. Read the conclusion

6. Pause and try telling yourself a story of what this paper tried to say. This story is usually wrong (to a certain extent), but it gives a scaffold to build your knowledge on.

7. Look back at your questions from step 1. Where (e.g., which section in the paper) would it be likely for you to gain the information?

8. Read those part that you guessed. Recursively apply step 2–7 at the section-level and paragraph-level.

9. Check whether your questions are answered. Were they answered clearly? Are there new questions that are essential for you to answer your questions? (E.g., some words in the paper that you don't know the meaning)

   * Do text search in the paper (better use computer in this step) to see where information that might help you. Selectively read that section by applying step 2–7.
   * If the paper doesn't give many clues about these, use Google.

10. Reflect if your questions are answered? How confident are you with the answers? What are alternative answers? Does this paper give you any hint for disregarding those alternatives?
